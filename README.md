- **Floating-Point Precision**: Limits results to five decimal places for improved accuracy in floating-point calculations.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: A cleaner, redesigned UI that improves user experience and visual appeal.

## üÜï What's New in Version 2.0

1. **Custom Arithmetic Handler**:
   - Replaces the `eval()` function used in Version 1.0, which often caused errors with leading zero inputs.
   - A custom class now handles arithmetic operations to improve robustness and avoid undefined behavior.

2. **Improved Floating-Point Precision**:
   - Arithmetic operations are rounded to a precision of five decimal places to ensure accurate calculations without unnecessary decimal points.

3. **UI Redesign**:
   - A more intuitive and visually appealing user interface, making the calculator easy to use and pleasing to interact with.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and UI enhancements.
- **JavaScript**: For arithmetic operations and handling calculator logic.

## üîß Future Enhancements

- **Scientific Calculator Features**: Add support for functions like square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations.
- **Keyboard Support**: Enable keyboard inputs for a more accessible user experience.
